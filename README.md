# Bifrost

Group project for the Data Science 2024/25 course.

The project is a Python application that provides a unified and simultaneous
interface to data stored in two different storage systems, a Blazegraph SPARQL
graph database containing metadata about the journals contained in the
[Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org), and a SQLite
relational database containing information of scholarly journals in terms of
their categories and areas of interest as extracted from
[Scimago Journal Rank](https://www.scimagojr.com/).

The project is built based on the [project specifications](https://github.com/comp-data/2024-2025/blob/main/docs/project/README.md) contained in the course repository.

## Project name
The project is named Bifrost after the legendary rainbow bridge from Norse
mythology, which connects the world of humans (Midgard) with the realm of the
gods (Asgard). In a similar spirit, this application acts as a bridge between
two different data storage systems, a relational SQLite database and a Blazegraph
SPARQL one, providing a unified interface to the data stored in both.
